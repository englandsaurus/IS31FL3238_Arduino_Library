[*Qwiic RV-8803 RTC Module (BOB-16281)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16281)

The RV-8803 is an extremely precise, low power, highly configurable RTC. Under ideal conditions it runs at approximately 240nA with +/-3ppm per year of deviation with a temperature compensated crystal.

This library allows the user to:

* Set time using hard numbers or the BUILD_TIME from the Arduino compiler
* Read time
* Configure various aspects of the RTC including setting of alarms, interrupts, and wave outputs

Examples are included to get you started
